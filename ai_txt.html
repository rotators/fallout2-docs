<h1>AI.TXT</h1>
<div style="width: 1200px; margin: auto;">
<p>The file consists of a description of combat parameters for the player and all NPC classes in the game. Descriptions are separated from one another with an empty line. Each description consists of the (unique) name of the class and settings. Below is a list of parameters in alphabetical order, which is how they are always written in the file. "string" means that the value should be text; "N" indicates a numeric value; and "mixed" can be either.</p>

<p>There seems to be a mismatch between some of the string values used and what the engine actually looks for. Potentially incorrect values are indicated with a (*).</p>

<h3>[Class Name]</h3>

<p>This option must be specified first. For example, [Enclave Patrol], [Fighting Mantis] or [Arroyo Villager]. The player is the class named Player AI. Every party member must have the following classes:</p>

<pre>[PARTY NAME BERSERK] 
[PARTY NAME AGGRESSIVE] 
[PARTY NAME DEFENSIVE]
[PARTY NAME COWARD] 
[PARTY NAME CUSTOM] 
</pre>

<p>Here NAME is the name of a member of the team, such as: DOC, LENNY, GORIS, etc. </p>
<p>NOTE: The combat ai-mode types for party members must always be in the above shown order, and the character must always start out in the CUSTOM-mode, otherwise the game will not be able to correctly detect the set ai-mode.</p>

<h3>aggression = N</h3>
<p>The chance of aggressive behavior by the NPC in combat. Measured as a percentage. Valid values are: 0-100.</p>

<h3>area_attack_mode = string</h3>

<p>Conditions for burst-fire. Existing values, the internal numeric representation, and the text used for setting custom behavior in-game:</p>

<pre>
no_pref*               -1  "Not Applicable."
always                  0  "Always!"
sometimes               1  "Sometimes, don't worry about hitting me"
be_sure                 2  "Be sure you won't hit me"
be_careful              3  "Be careful not to hit me"
be_absolutely_sure      4  "Be absolutely sure you won't hit me"
</pre>

<p>'no_pref' is used by Cyberdog and Goris, and has a line in custom.msg, but is not checked for by the engine.</p>
<p>For party members, these options must be defined in the party.txt file.</p>

<h3>combat float</h3>
attack_end = N

Combat floats said when attacking. At the beginning of the attack, a random number between the two values is chosen. Then the appropriate line number from master.dat/text/english/game/combatai.msg is displayed.

When you create a new AI package, the value of packet_num must be consecutive. In AI.TXT there are 187 values for packet_num, from 0 to 186 inclusive. If you want to add a new package, it should have packet_num 187, the next added package 188, and so on. If packet_num is not followed consecutively, for example, 188 immediately after 186, the mapper will close.
