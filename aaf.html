<h1>AAF File Format</h1>
<p>The AAF Font File Format is used to store fonts in Fallouts 1 & 2. Only the AAF files used in the English versions are discussed here, there may or may not be variations for other languages.</p>

<p>The AAF file stores a separate glyph for each of the 256 position in the ASCII table. The fonts in an AAF file are typically non-fixed size, i.e. each glyph has it's own width and height. A glyph is defined by a rectangular bitmap representing the pixels of the glyph, corresponding to the way that it appears on the screen. Each pixel can have a possible value in the range of 0 to 9.</p>

<ul>
  <li>0 means that the pixel is transparent.</li>
  <li>The values 1 to 9 represent the relative brightness of that pixel, with 9 being the brightest. There does not appear to be a linear increase in brightness from values 1 to 9.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of the bitmap of a glyph. This glyph is from the file FONT1.AAF and represents the character 'b' (ASCII 98).</p>

<pre style="background: #222; margin: 10px; width: 80px; padding: 5px;">

  77    
  777763
  77  76
  77  77
  77  76
  777763
</pre>

<p>Pixels with value 0 are not shown as they are transparent. The higher numbers 7 and 6 represent the brighter parts of the glyph, while the 3 would be much duller in colour. This would be expected for the rounder corners of the b.</p>
